## General Info
This repository is created to complete Project for the Fundamentals for Data Analysiss module as part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics in Computing.

This repository contains a folder with a number of Jupyter Notebooks for weekly topics and a separate Jupyter notebook that contains the main concepts of the normal distribution. It also contains the dataset file that we are to synthesise along with the Python code used to model the data and an image file.

## Technologies
To run the noteboook on your local machine you will need Pyhton 3.9 or above. This notebook has been completed using Anaconda and the following imported the following libraries;

'''
- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #for plotting
- import sys
- import seaborn as sns

'''

## Setup
To run this notebook on a local machine you should do the following:
1. Open the command line on your machine. I use terminal in Visual Studio code but also recommend CMDer if working on a Windows device.
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the downloaded notebook
3. In the terminal type "Jupyter Notebook" and press "Enter"
4. This will open the notebook on the Jupyter browser

The Python code is stored within the relevantJupyter Notebooks and can be run on any terminal. For this project I used visual studio code for ease of pushing to GitHub.
