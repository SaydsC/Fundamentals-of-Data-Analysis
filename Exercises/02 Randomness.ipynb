    "This question uses the principles of Binomial Distribution and how to use it to apply the probability of a success or failure of an outcome in a survey or experiment. In this topic we looked at the probability of getting a head or tail in a coin toss. Having previously studied Probability I recognised the application of Pascal's Triangle and the n choose k method. Pascals's Triangle shows us how many ways heads and tails can combine and therefore the probability of any combination.[Introduction to Probability Theory, Hoel Port Stone 1971]\n",
