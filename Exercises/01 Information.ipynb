It's not a real number, because you can never get zero by raising anything to the power of anything else. You can never reach zero, you can only approach it using an infinitely large and negative power.[http://www.mclph.umn.edu/mathrefresh/logs3.html#:~:text=2.-,log%200%20is%20undefined.,infinitely%20large%20and%20negative%20power]\n",
